<h1><b>Project 1 for CSCI-E15</b></h1>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>Shirley Hui</p>
<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
I am a Senior Software Engineer, Technical Project Lead and Project Manager.

I have worked on applications (Rational ClearCase/ClearQuest and Jazz Platform products - Requirements Management, Product Management and Quality Management) and language compilers (COBOL, Ada, FORTRAN, both front-end and vector and parallel optimizers). I've played a role in almost every aspect of the software development lifecycle.
</p>

<p>I know a bunch about databases and web applications - though mostly server side, some dabbling in Dojo/Ajax, Javascript. I know basic HTML (mostly know where to look up what I don't know) and I'm learning the intricacies of CSS and what's different in HTML5.  I've never built a real website from scratch.
</p>
<p>
I'm married, with 3 sons (16, 20, 24), originally from New York City, now from Natick.
</p>
<p>
My personal passions are my family, cooking (from scratch and fresh ingredients, as much as possible), gardening and knitting. Here are a couple of highlights from this spring's garden:

<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>I am using Emacs, although I plan to try Sublime Text.</p>
