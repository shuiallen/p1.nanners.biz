<h1><b>Project 1 for CSCI-E15</b></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Shirley Hui</p>
<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
I am a Senior Software Engineer, Technical Project Lead and Project Manager.

I have worked on applications (Rational ClearCase/ClearQuest and Jazz Platform products - Requirements Management, Product Management and Quality Management) and compilers (COBOL, Ada, FORTRAN - both front-end and vector and parallel optimizers). 

I've played a role in every aspect of the software development lifecycle including planning and requirements gathering, development, testing, documentation, training, support, pre-Sales and post-Sales activities.
</p>
<p> 
Despite all that experience, I've never built a website from scratch.

</p>
<p>  I know HTML and I'm learning the intricacies of CSS and what's different in HTML5
</p>
<p>
I'm married, with 3 sons (16, 20, 24), originally from New York City, now from Natick.
</p>
<p>
My personal passions are my family, cooking (from scratch and fresh ingredients, as much as possible), gardening and knitting.

</p>

<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>I am using Emacs, although I plan to try Sublime Text.</p>
